# BMI Calculation Algorithm and Flowchart

## Algorithm

1. **Start**
2. **Enter** a continuous loop.
3. **Output explanation**: Display "This is a BMI test."
4. **Input height**: Prompt the user to input their height in meters:
   - If height is zero, display an error message and prompt for re-entry.
5. **Input height**: Prompt the user to input their weight in kilograms.
6. **Calculate BMI**: using the formula:  
   BMI = weight/(height)^2
7. **Output BMI**: Display the BMI value.
8. **Calculate BMI**: Determine BMI category:
   - If BMI > 25, display "You are overweight."
   - Else if BMI is between 18.5 and 25, display "You have a normal weight."
   - Otherwise, display "You are underweight."
9. **Choice to loop**: Ask the user if they want to calculate again (input 'y' for yes):
   - If 'y', repeat the loop.
   - Otherwise, exit the loop.
10. **End**
