## Algorithm

1. **Start**: Begin the program.
2. **Input user details**:
   - Ask the user to input their name, weekly working hours, bonus rate per hour, and base salary.
3. **Validate input**:
   - If the bonus rate is negative, prompt the user again until a valid value is entered.
4. **Calculate bonus payment**:
   - Subtract 48 (national workweek hours) from the weekly working hours to find overtime hours.
   - Multiply overtime hours by the bonus rate to calculate the bonus payment.
5. **Calculate gross salary**: Add the base salary and bonus payment.
6. **Calculate deductions**:
   - Calculate pension as 5% of the base salary.
   - Calculate tax as 15% of the base salary.
7. **Calculate net salary**: Subtract deductions from the gross salary.
